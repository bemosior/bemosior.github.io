title: About
---

As a generalist with a diverse technical background, I focus my energy on working effectively in all circumstances while bringing people together. I value autonomy, learning, and the pursuit of fundamental understanding. I enjoy analysis, strategy, and helping others succeed.

For background information, see my [resume](/resume.html). I have personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/bemosior) and provide consulting services through [Unica Labs](http://unicalabs.com). [Email](mailto:bemosior+com@gmail.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BenjaminMosior) are effective ways to reach me. Oh yeah, and then there's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-mosior-82635249), I guess.
