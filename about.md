*I try* to understand systems and diminish the pain inflicted by them. *I believe* technology should augment but not replace human practice. *I know* social processes are not predictable and require flexibility and experimentation if positive outcomes are to be achieved.

[Email](mailto:bemosior+com@gmail.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BenjaminMosior) are effective ways to reach me. For background information, see my [resume](/resume.html). I have personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/bemosior) and provide consulting services through [Unica Labs](http://unicalabs.com).
