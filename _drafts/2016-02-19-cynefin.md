The Cynefin framework reveals that Complicated or Simple approaches break down and can only succeed *by complete accident* in Complex circumstances, because causality is only clear in retrospect. Let's briefly refute the notion of culture change as Simple or Complicated.

With the Simple approach, a modern management "best practice" might be to create an incentive program. We know, however, that [people are not endlessly manipulable or predictable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc). We also know that incentives are [not sufficient cause for culture change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_of_culture). In other words, the Simple solution will fail (or only succeed by accident).

On the other hand, a large company with sufficient funding might hire expert consultants to analyze the company culture, define a desired future state, and provide good tactics to drive towards it (a Complicated solution). We know from experience, however, that the disposition of the workforce might prevent otherwise good tactics, even those that have succeeded at countless other companies, from working again here. Complicated solutions are too generic for a particular company and time.

As an aside, the counter to systemic rejection of forced change seems to be centered on wearing down the will of the workforce, which is simply harmful. Worse, success might be declared after enough people quit and are replaced.
