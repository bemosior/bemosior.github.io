I have been searching for a work visualization method to adequately convey both how a given process works and the WIP (Work In Progress) at any given moment. In the former case, improvement is always a goal, but a prerequisite for any productive discussion is a common understanding. In the latter case, understanding WIP prevents us from making a bad process worse and frees up capacity to improve.

Kanban seemed like something to try, but I realized I was considering only the information Kanban provides and not the functional purpose it is intended to fulfill.

More specifically, with an organizational addiction to *pushing* work through the system (as opposed to *pulling*), a Kanban representation will fail to account for control over the release of work, allowing for further "inventory" buildup between steps.

Kanban is also problematic because representation of a nonlinear flow in terms of system constraints isn't accounted for (i.e., one particular step performed at one particular station precludes the ability of a different step at that same station to be performed).

I considered a value stream map next, but the detail of a fully-formed VSM would only serve as a barrier to common understanding and is not meant to represent WIP. Perhaps a simplified form would suffice:

This works particularly well to convey circumstances where a resource (or a person) might be busy with another step of the process, such as with Workstation A above with the work from Workstation C piling up in front of it. This visualization steals a bit from Critical Chain concepts, by acknowledging the utilization and occupation of individual resources.

A diagram like this can serve as a temporary means for establishing common understanding of the process and the work flowing through it. Limiting the release of work then offers improvement in flow and opportunity to catch our breath enough to improve.
