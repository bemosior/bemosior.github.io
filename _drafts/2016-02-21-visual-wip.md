title: Visual WIP

I have been searching for a work visualization method to adequately convey both how a given process works and the WIP (Work In Progress) at any given moment. In the former case, improvement is always a goal, but a prerequisite for any productive discussion is a common understanding. In the latter case, understanding WIP helps us not make a bad process worse, so we have space to improve.

Kanban seemed like something to try, but I realized I was considering only the information Kanban provides and not the functional purpose it fulfills.

More specifically, an organizational addiction to *pushing* work through the system (as opposed to *pulling*, as the Kanban system needs) means our work "inventory" builds up between steps.

Kanban also would not be appropriate, as representation of a nonlinear flow in terms of system constraints would be necessary (one particular step performed at one particular station precludes the ability of a different step at that same station to be performed).

I considered a value stream map next, but the detail of a fully-formed VSM would only serve as a barrier to participation and is not meant to represent WIP. Perhaps a simplified form would suffice.
