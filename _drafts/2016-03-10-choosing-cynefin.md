For necessary context, I recommend reading a previous post, [Cynefin, Culture Change as Complex]({% post_url 2016-02-27-cynefin-culture-change-complex %}).

Cynefin did not make sense to me for more than 6 months. I ran into it a number of times, but each jaunt to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework) left me disappointed. 

At that point in my life, I had been drawn into Goldratt's [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) and concepts such as [Systems Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking). For a time, I viewed every problem as if it belonged to an ordered system governed by constraints, but the ability to truly apply the theory ([praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis)) frequently escaped my grasp. I wanted to get some use out of all that reading, but it wasn't meant to be.

The Cynefin Framework is a sense-making framework, not a categorization framework (although it can be subtly reframed to have great value as a means of categorization).
