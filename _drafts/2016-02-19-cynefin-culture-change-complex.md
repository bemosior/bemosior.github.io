The Cynefin framework reveals that Complicated or Simple approaches break down and can only succeed *by complete accident* in Complex circumstances, because causality is only clear in retrospect. Let's briefly refute the notion of culture change as Simple or Complicated.

# Culture as Simple

Simple concepts have obvious cause-effect relationships. We can sense the situation, pattern-match to categorize it, and respond with the best practice. 

The dominant management theory "best practice" for culture change is the manipulation of incentives. [People are not endlessly manipulable or predictable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc), however, and incentives are [not the only path to culture change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_of_culture), so the notion of "best practice" is incorrect. We also know from the vastness of fields of study, such as [Anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology), that humanity and culture are not "obvious" concepts. Culture is not Simple.

# Culture as Complicated

Complicated concepts have cause-effect relationships that can be discovered through analysis. We can sense the situation, bring in experts to analyze and understand, and respond with good practice.

A large company with sufficient funding might hire expert consultants to analyze the company culture, define a desired future state, and provide "good practice" to drive towards it. We know from experience, however, that the disposition of the workforce might prevent otherwise good tactics, even those that have succeeded at countless other companies, from working again here. Complicated solutions are too generic for a particular company and time.

As an aside, the counter to systemic rejection of forced change seems to be centered on wearing down the will of the workforce, which is simply harmful. Worse, success might be declared after enough people quit and are replaced.

Culture is not Complicated.
