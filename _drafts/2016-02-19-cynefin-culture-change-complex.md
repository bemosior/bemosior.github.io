The Cynefin framework reveals that Complicated or Simple approaches break down and can only succeed *by complete accident* in Complex circumstances, because causality is only clear in retrospect. Let's briefly refute the notion of culture change as Simple or Complicated.

# Culture as Simple

The Simple domain has obvious, predictable cause-effect relationships. We can sense the situation, pattern-match to categorize it, and respond with the best practice. 

The dominant management theory "best practice" for culture change is the manipulation of incentives. [People are not endlessly manipulable or predictable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc), however, and incentives are [not the only path to culture change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_of_culture), so the notion of "best practice" is incorrect. We also know from the vastness of fields of study, such as [Anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology), that humanity and culture are not "obvious" concepts. Culture is not Simple.


# Culture as Complicated

The Complicated domain has cause-effect relationships, but they are not obvious. We can sense the situation, perform analysis or bring in experts, and respond with one or more good practices.

The standard procedure for companies aiming to change culture involves hiring expert consultants to analyze the current culture, define a desired future state, and provide "good practice" to drive towards it. We know from experience, however, that the disposition of the workforce or the company might prevent otherwise good tactics, even those that have succeeded at countless other companies, from working again. 

Consider all the variables that might derail a given solution, including untimely personnel changes, lifechanging events for critical people, unrelated shifts in individual attitudes, and distracting business crises. These events are completely out of the control of any company or consultant. Complicated solutions are simply too generic for a particular company at a particular point in time. Culture is not Complicated.

As an aside, the counter to systemic rejection of forced change seems to be centered on wearing down the will of the workforce, which is simply harmful. Worse, success might be declared after enough people have quit and been replaced.


# Culture as Complex

The Complex domain lacks causality, except in retrospect. We can probe the situation with safe-to-fail experiments, sense the effects, and respond with amplification or dampening strategies. Culture change lies in this domain.

> Culture arises from actions in the world, ways of doing things which may never be articulated, and which may not be capable of articulation.  In effect culture is always complex, never complicated.  So it follows that cultural change is an evolutionary process from the present, not an idealised future state design.
