My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, well daddy don't you know that things go in cycles
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael

I work in a challenging environment where the effects of improvement efforts are only perceivable in retrospect over quite some time. It is one thing to state that improvement has occurred, even to cite specific examples as evidence, and something else altogether to vividly experience the difference. (We humans tend to recalibrate our expectations frequently based on current circumstance, but our perception often misses the quiet signals of small changes over time).

One way or another, the circumstance has led me to notice that motivation waxes and wanes in a somewhat cyclical pattern.

Objectively, a motivation model being cyclical is not problematic, as long as some degree of positive learning or other progress can be observed along the way. I'm not yet sure if "learning" is the right way to describe it, though, or if there should even be a linear measure of it in the first place. It seems that a cycle can enable a new level of *something*, be it fundamental understanding, existence, or maybe happiness.

Assuming the *something* is positive, we want to exploit such a model to maximize the movement in a positive direction (i.e., towards periods of high motivation) while minimizing the opposite.

The problem is that these cycles can vary in severity, length, and frequency, but no cause will be immediately apparent. In other words, motivation is complex.

Complexity isn't a reason to give up. Rather, [operating within a complex space necessitates deliberate experimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework). The key is to amplify the effects of good experiment results and dampen those of poor ones.

Recognition of the cyclical nature of motivation enables certain awarenesses. For example, what does a series of motivation cycles without positive movement in learning or improvement or that *something* indicate?

All I know is that I do not want to be there, so an experiment is in order.

What is the effect on the motivation cycle of a day's vacation, timed with a trend towards "unmotivated"? If the effect is positive, then it can be amplified through more deliberate future use of vacation time or restructuring of work hours (if the flexibility is there). If the effect is negative, it can be dampened by pursuing other activities already known to be motivating.

I ran such an experiment, and found myself recovering by the following day ("hopeful"). As a result, I plan to allocate half my accrued vacation time for this purpose in order to amplify the effect over time.

The joy is that there are endless experiments to be run. What about increasing focus on my reading list when motivation wanes? Or hitting the gym? Experimenting in this space seems like common sense, now that I've had the chance to explore the idea. But that's the point; this is knowledge that can only be gained in retrospect.
