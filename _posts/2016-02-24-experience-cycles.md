>You could find the Abstract listening to hip hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, well daddy don't you know that things go in cycles
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael

I work in a challenging environment where the effects of improvement efforts are only perceivable in retrospect over quite some time. In occasional moments of clarity, I can consciously recognize that a current positive approach or behavior might not have been possible at a particular point in the past, but it can be frustrating and defeating during many other moments to crash hopelessly against barriers tied to systemic organizational inertia.

I find this experience has a noticeable impact on motivation, though it seems to follow a cyclical pattern:

And that is all well and good, as long as some degree of learning (or other positive progress) occurs along the way.

These cycles can vary in severity, length, and frequency.
