              <h2 class="content-head">About</h2>

              <p>Benjamin Mosior is an operations generalist with experience in systems architecture, scalability, high availability, and automation. He is not afraid to dig into code (and often does), thoroughly enjoys fixing small problems that greatly affect the everyday user experience, and loves the challenge of breaking massive problems down to size.</p>

              <p>Above all, he believes in the organizational phenomenon known as DevOps, where silos are broken down and cross-functional employees work together to build great things. He acknowledges that the tools may be important but emphasizes that the real value is in the culture.</p>

              <p>Benjamin has resigned from his position at Shippensburg University, effective late September, 2014. He plans to take some time to focus his work as an independent consultant but would be available for the right opportunity starting September 29th (remote) and December 1st (relocation) in 2014.</p>

            <h2 class="content-head content-head-ribbon">Interests</h2>

            <p>Benjamin takes a keen interest in systems monitoring and making information more readily available to those that need it. In his mind, greater access to knowledge adds value to a business and sets the stage for a data-driven approach to problem-solving. In his free time, Ben hones his professional skills and engages customers as an independent consultant.</p>

            <p>To balance out his interests, he often unwinds by composing electronic music and practicing percussion on his Roland drum kit.</p>
